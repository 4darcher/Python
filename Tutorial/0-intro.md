# Data Structures Tutorial
**Welcome**  
  
It is necessary to understand data structures if a person wants to be a better programmer. Knowledge of structures and algorithms will help the computer scientist throughout their career. Data structures are needed for organizing storage in computers. When data is properly organized humans can access and edit it. We are going to go through three examples, and learn how efficient each solution is. This tutorial is going to discuss stacks, linked lists, and tree. At the end of each section there is a practice problem to help you implement what you have learned. Please try to figure out the solution on your own before chacking the solution. The link to each solution is found at the end of each section. All the examples and the practice problems are written in Python.
